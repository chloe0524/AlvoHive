## [CVE-2015-5600](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-5600)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.





## [CVE-2016-6515](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-6515)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The auth_password function in auth-passwd.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3 does not limit password lengths for password authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crypt CPU consumption) via a long string.





## [CVE-2016-10009](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10009)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Untrusted search path vulnerability in ssh-agent.c in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 7.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary local PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.





## [CVE-2016-1908](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-1908)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The client in OpenSSH before 7.2 mishandles failed cookie generation for untrusted X11 forwarding and relies on the local X11 server for access-control decisions, which allows remote X11 clients to trigger a fallback and obtain trusted X11 forwarding privileges by leveraging configuration issues on this X11 server, as demonstrated by lack of the SECURITY extension on this X11 server.





## [CVE-2015-8325](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-8325)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The do_setup_env function in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 7.2p2, when the UseLogin feature is enabled and PAM is configured to read .pam_environment files in user home directories, allows local users to gain privileges by triggering a crafted environment for the /bin/login program, as demonstrated by an LD_PRELOAD environment variable.





## [CVE-2016-10012](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10012)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.





## [CVE-2015-6564](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-6564)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Use-after-free vulnerability in the mm_answer_pam_free_ctx function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX request.





## [CVE-2016-10010](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10010)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4, when privilege separation is not used, creates forwarded Unix-domain sockets as root, which might allow local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors, related to serverloop.c.





## [CVE-2020-15778](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-15778)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: scp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in the scp.c toremote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the destination argument. NOTE: the vendor reportedly has stated that they intentionally omit validation of "anomalous argument transfers" because that could "stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows."





## [CVE-2019-6111](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-6111)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).





## [CVE-2016-3115](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-3115)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.2p2 allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended shell-command restrictions via crafted X11 forwarding data, related to the (1) do_authenticated1 and (2) session_x11_req functions.





## [CVE-2017-15906](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-15906)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The process_open function in sftp-server.c in OpenSSH before 7.6 does not properly prevent write operations in readonly mode, which allows attackers to create zero-length files.





## [CVE-2016-10708](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10708)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an out-of-sequence NEWKEYS message, as demonstrated by Honggfuzz, related to kex.c and packet.c.





## [CVE-2018-15473](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-15473)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c.





## [CVE-2018-15919](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-15919)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system when GSS2 is in use. NOTE: the discoverer states 'We understand that the OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or "oracle") as a vulnerability.'





## [CVE-2016-0778](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-0778)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by requesting many forwardings.





## [CVE-2021-41617](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-41617)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.





## [CVE-2015-5352](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-5352)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The x11_open_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH before 6.9, when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacks a check of the refusal deadline for X connections, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the permitted time window.





## [CVE-2016-6210](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-6210)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate users by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a large password is provided.





## [CVE-2020-14145](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-14145)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.





## [CVE-2016-20012](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-20012)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a suspicion that a certain combination of username and public key is known to an SSH server, to test whether this suspicion is correct. This occurs because a challenge is sent only when that combination could be valid for a login session. NOTE: the vendor does not recognize user enumeration as a vulnerability for this product





## [CVE-2016-0777](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-0777)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The resend_bytes function in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2 allows remote servers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by requesting transmission of an entire buffer, as demonstrated by reading a private key.





## [CVE-2019-6109](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-6109)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.





## [CVE-2019-6110](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-6110)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred.





## [CVE-2018-20685](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-20685)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.





## [CVE-2021-36368](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-36368)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed.





## [CVE-2016-10011](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10011)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: authfile.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not properly consider the effects of realloc on buffer contents, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a privilege-separated child process.





## [CVE-2015-6563](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-6563)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms accepts extraneous username data in MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX requests, which allows local users to conduct impersonation attacks by leveraging any SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid to send a crafted MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and monitor_wrap.c.





## [CVE-2023-38408](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-38408)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.





## [CVE-2023-48795](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-48795)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API before 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT, Dropbear through 2022.83, Ssh before 5.1.1 in Erlang/OTP, PuTTY before 0.80, AsyncSSH before 2.14.2, golang.org/x/crypto before 0.17.0, libssh before 0.10.6, libssh2 through 1.11.0, Thorn Tech SFTP Gateway before 3.4.6, Tera Term before 5.1, Paramiko before 3.4.0, jsch before 0.2.15, SFTPGo before 2.5.6, Netgate pfSense Plus through 23.09.1, Netgate pfSense CE through 2.7.2, HPN-SSH through 18.2.0, ProFTPD before 1.3.8b (and before 1.3.9rc2), ORYX CycloneSSH before 2.3.4, NetSarang XShell 7 before Build 0144, CrushFTP before 10.6.0, ConnectBot SSH library before 2.2.22, Apache MINA sshd through 2.11.0, sshj through 0.37.0, TinySSH through 20230101, trilead-ssh2 6401, LANCOM LCOS and LANconfig, FileZilla before 3.66.4, Nova before 11.8, PKIX-SSH before 14.4, SecureCRT before 9.4.3, Transmit5 before 5.10.4, Win32-OpenSSH before 9.5.0.0p1-Beta, WinSCP before 6.2.2, Bitvise SSH Server before 9.32, Bitvise SSH Client before 9.33, KiTTY through 0.76.1.13, the net-ssh gem 7.2.0 for Ruby, the mscdex ssh2 module before 1.15.0 for Node.js, the thrussh library before 0.35.1 for Rust, and the Russh crate before 0.40.2 for Rust.





## [CVE-2023-51385](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-51385)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For example, an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell metacharacters in a user name or host name.





## [CVE-2014-2323](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2014-2323)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: SQL injection vulnerability in mod_mysql_vhost.c in lighttpd before 1.4.35 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the host name, related to request_check_hostname.





## [CVE-2019-11072](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-11072)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: lighttpd before 1.4.54 has a signed integer overflow, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malicious HTTP GET request, as demonstrated by mishandling of /%2F? in burl_normalize_2F_to_slash_fix in burl.c. NOTE: The developer states "The feature which can be abused to cause the crash is a new feature in lighttpd 1.4.50, and is not enabled by default. It must be explicitly configured in the config file (e.g. lighttpd.conf). Certain input will trigger an abort() in lighttpd when that feature is enabled. lighttpd detects the underflow or realloc() will fail (in both 32-bit and 64-bit executables), also detected in lighttpd. Either triggers an explicit abort() by lighttpd. This is not exploitable beyond triggering the explicit abort() with subsequent application exit.





## [CVE-2014-2324](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2014-2324)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:lighttpd:lighttpd:1.4.33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*
