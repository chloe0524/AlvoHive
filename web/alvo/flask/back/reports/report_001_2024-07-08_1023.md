## [CVE-2011-2523](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2011-2523)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:vsftpd_project:vsftpd:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: vsftpd 2.3.4 downloaded between 20110630 and 20110703 contains a backdoor which opens a shell on port 6200/tcp.





## [CVE-2021-3618](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-3618)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:vsftpd_project:vsftpd:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion attack, exploiting TLS servers implementing different protocols but using compatible certificates, such as multi-domain or wildcard certificates. A MiTM attacker having access to victim's traffic at the TCP/IP layer can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another, resulting in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of one protocol service may compromise the other at the application layer.





## [CVE-2010-4478](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2010-4478)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:4.7p1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: OpenSSH 5.6 and earlier, when J-PAKE is enabled, does not properly validate the public parameters in the J-PAKE protocol, which allows remote attackers to bypass the need for knowledge of the shared secret, and successfully authenticate, by sending crafted values in each round of the protocol, a related issue to CVE-2010-4252.





## [CVE-2010-4755](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2010-4755)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:4.7p1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The (1) remote_glob function in sftp-glob.c and the (2) process_put function in sftp.c in OpenSSH 5.8 and earlier, as used in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, OpenBSD 4.7, and other products, allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in SSH_FXP_STAT requests to an sftp daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.





## [CVE-2008-5161](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2008-5161)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:4.7p1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Error handling in the SSH protocol in (1) SSH Tectia Client and Server and Connector 4.0 through 4.4.11, 5.0 through 5.2.4, and 5.3 through 5.3.8; Client and Server and ConnectSecure 6.0 through 6.0.4; Server for Linux on IBM System z 6.0.4; Server for IBM z/OS 5.5.1 and earlier, 6.0.0, and 6.0.1; and Client 4.0-J through 4.3.3-J and 4.0-K through 4.3.10-K; and (2) OpenSSH 4.7p1 and possibly other versions, when using a block cipher algorithm in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, makes it easier for remote attackers to recover certain plaintext data from an arbitrary block of ciphertext in an SSH session via unknown vectors.





## [CVE-2004-0998](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2004-0998)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:telnetd:telnetd:0.17.25:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Format string vulnerability in telnetd-ssl 0.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.





## [CVE-2011-0411](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2011-0411)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:postfix:postfix:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The STARTTLS implementation in Postfix 2.4.x before 2.4.16, 2.5.x before 2.5.12, 2.6.x before 2.6.9, and 2.7.x before 2.7.3 does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext command that is processed after TLS is in place, related to a "plaintext command injection" attack.





## [CVE-2011-1720](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2011-1720)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:postfix:postfix:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The SMTP server in Postfix before 2.5.13, 2.6.x before 2.6.10, 2.7.x before 2.7.4, and 2.8.x before 2.8.3, when certain Cyrus SASL authentication methods are enabled, does not create a new server handle after client authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an invalid AUTH command with one method followed by an AUTH command with a different method.





## [CVE-2017-10140](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-10140)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:postfix:postfix:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Postfix before 2.11.10, 3.0.x before 3.0.10, 3.1.x before 3.1.6, and 3.2.x before 3.2.2 might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging undocumented functionality in Berkeley DB 2.x and later, related to reading settings from DB_CONFIG in the current directory.





## [CVE-2008-3889](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2008-3889)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:postfix:postfix:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Postfix 2.4 before 2.4.9, 2.5 before 2.5.5, and 2.6 before 2.6-20080902, when used with the Linux 2.6 kernel, leaks epoll file descriptors during execution of "non-Postfix" commands, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (application slowdown or exit) via a crafted command, as demonstrated by a command in a .forward file.





## [CVE-2023-51764](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-51764)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:postfix:postfix:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Postfix through 3.8.5 allows SMTP smuggling unless configured with smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining and smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords=chunking (or certain other options that exist in recent versions). Remote attackers can use a published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because Postfix supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers do not. To prevent attack variants (by always disallowing <LF> without <CR>), a different solution is required, such as the smtpd_forbid_bare_newline=yes option with a Postfix minimum version of 3.5.23, 3.6.13, 3.7.9, 3.8.4, or 3.9.





## [CVE-2008-0122](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2008-0122)

NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-4022.





## [CVE-2016-6170](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-6170)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:isc:bind:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: ISC BIND through 9.9.9-P1, 9.10.x through 9.10.4-P1, and 9.11.x through 9.11.0b1 allows primary DNS servers to cause a denial of service (secondary DNS server crash) via a large AXFR response, and possibly allows IXFR servers to cause a denial of service (IXFR client crash) via a large IXFR response and allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (primary DNS server crash) via a large UPDATE message.





## [CVE-2018-5741](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-5741)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:isc:bind:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: To provide fine-grained controls over the ability to use Dynamic DNS (DDNS) to update records in a zone, BIND 9 provides a feature called update-policy. Various rules can be configured to limit the types of updates that can be performed by a client, depending on the key used when sending the update request. Unfortunately, some rule types were not initially documented, and when documentation for them was added to the Administrator Reference Manual (ARM) in change #3112, the language that was added to the ARM at that time incorrectly described the behavior of two rule types, krb5-subdomain and ms-subdomain. This incorrect documentation could mislead operators into believing that policies they had configured were more restrictive than they actually were. This affects BIND versions prior to BIND 9.11.5 and BIND 9.12.3.

## [CVE-2023-45802](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-45802)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.0.36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

Summary: The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1a (Affected 1.1.1).





## [CVE-2020-1971](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-1971)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.0.51a:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

## [CVE-2017-15698](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-15698)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat_native:1.1.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: When parsing the AIA-Extension field of a client certificate, Apache Tomcat Native Connector 1.2.0 to 1.2.14 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle fields longer than 127 bytes. The result of the parsing error was to skip the OCSP check. It was therefore possible for client certificates that should have been rejected (if the OCSP check had been made) to be accepted. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.





## [CVE-2018-8019](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-8019)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat_native:1.1.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: When using an OCSP responder Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 did not correctly handle invalid responses. This allowed for revoked client certificates to be incorrectly identified. It was therefore possible for users to authenticate with revoked certificates when using mutual TLS. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.





## [CVE-2018-8020](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-8020)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:tomcat_native:1.1.23:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Apache Tomcat Native 1.2.0 to 1.2.16 and 1.1.23 to 1.1.34 has a flaw that does not properly check OCSP pre-produced responses, which are lists (multiple entries) of certificate statuses. Subsequently, revoked client certificates may not be properly identified, allowing for users to authenticate with revoked certificates to connections that require mutual TLS. Users not using OCSP checks are not affected by this vulnerability.
