 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The mod_tls module in ProFTPD before 1.3.5b and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc2 does not properly handle the TLSDHParamFile directive, which might cause a weaker than intended Diffie-Hellman (DH) key to be used and consequently allow attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.





## [CVE-2019-18217](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-18217)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: ProFTPD before 1.3.6b and 1.3.7rc before 1.3.7rc2 allows remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to incorrect handling of overly long commands because main.c in a child process enters an infinite loop.





## [CVE-2019-19270](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-19270)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.





## [CVE-2019-19271](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-19271)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD before 1.3.6. A wrong iteration variable, used when checking a client certificate against CRL entries (installed by a system administrator), can cause some CRL entries to be ignored, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.





## [CVE-2019-19272](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-19272)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD before 1.3.6. Direct dereference of a NULL pointer (a variable initialized to NULL) leads to a crash when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server mutual-authentication setup.





## [CVE-2020-9272](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-9272)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: ProFTPD 1.3.7 has an out-of-bounds (OOB) read vulnerability in mod_cap via the cap_text.c cap_to_text function.





## [CVE-2013-4359](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2013-4359)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Integer overflow in kbdint.c in mod_sftp in ProFTPD 1.3.4d and 1.3.5r3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large response count value in an authentication request, which triggers a large memory allocation.





## [CVE-2019-19269](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-19269)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. A dereference of a NULL pointer may occur. This pointer is returned by the OpenSSL sk_X509_REVOKED_value() function when encountering an empty CRL installed by a system administrator. The dereference occurs when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server mutual-authentication setup.





## [CVE-2017-7418](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-7418)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: ProFTPD before 1.3.5e and 1.3.6 before 1.3.6rc5 controls whether the home directory of a user could contain a symbolic link through the AllowChrootSymlinks configuration option, but checks only the last path component when enforcing AllowChrootSymlinks. Attackers with local access could bypass the AllowChrootSymlinks control by replacing a path component (other than the last one) with a symbolic link. The threat model includes an attacker who is not granted full filesystem access by a hosting provider, but can reconfigure the home directory of an FTP user.





## [CVE-2021-46854](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-46854)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: mod_radius in ProFTPD before 1.3.7c allows memory disclosure to RADIUS servers because it copies blocks of 16 characters.





## [CVE-2023-48795](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-48795)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used) the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick Synergy Java SSH API before 3.1.0-SNAPSHOT, Dropbear through 2022.83, Ssh before 5.1.1 in Erlang/OTP, PuTTY before 0.80, AsyncSSH before 2.14.2, golang.org/x/crypto before 0.17.0, libssh before 0.10.6, libssh2 through 1.11.0, Thorn Tech SFTP Gateway before 3.4.6, Tera Term before 5.1, Paramiko before 3.4.0, jsch before 0.2.15, SFTPGo before 2.5.6, Netgate pfSense Plus through 23.09.1, Netgate pfSense CE through 2.7.2, HPN-SSH through 18.2.0, ProFTPD before 1.3.8b (and before 1.3.9rc2), ORYX CycloneSSH before 2.3.4, NetSarang XShell 7 before Build 0144, CrushFTP before 10.6.0, ConnectBot SSH library before 2.2.22, Apache MINA sshd through 2.11.0, sshj through 0.37.0, TinySSH through 20230101, trilead-ssh2 6401, LANCOM LCOS and LANconfig, FileZilla before 3.66.4, Nova before 11.8, PKIX-SSH before 14.4, SecureCRT before 9.4.3, Transmit5 before 5.10.4, Win32-OpenSSH before 9.5.0.0p1-Beta, WinSCP before 6.2.2, Bitvise SSH Server before 9.32, Bitvise SSH Client before 9.33, KiTTY through 0.76.1.13, the net-ssh gem 7.2.0 for Ruby, the mscdex ssh2 module before 1.15.0 for Node.js, the thrussh library before 0.35.1 for Rust, and the Russh crate before 0.40.2 for Rust.





## [CVE-2023-51713](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-51713)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:proftpd:proftpd:1.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: make_ftp_cmd in main.c in ProFTPD before 1.3.8a has a one-byte out-of-bounds read, and daemon crash, because of mishandling of quote/backslash semantics.





## [CVE-2015-5600](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-5600)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The kbdint_next_device function in auth2-chall.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 6.9 does not properly restrict the processing of keyboard-interactive devices within a single connection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force attacks or cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a long and duplicative list in the ssh -oKbdInteractiveDevices option, as demonstrated by a modified client that provides a different password for each pam element on this list.





## [CVE-2016-6515](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-6515)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The auth_password function in auth-passwd.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3 does not limit password lengths for password authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crypt CPU consumption) via a long string.





## [CVE-2016-10009](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10009)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Untrusted search path vulnerability in ssh-agent.c in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 7.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary local PKCS#11 modules by leveraging control over a forwarded agent-socket.





## [CVE-2016-1908](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-1908)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The client in OpenSSH before 7.2 mishandles failed cookie generation for untrusted X11 forwarding and relies on the local X11 server for access-control decisions, which allows remote X11 clients to trigger a fallback and obtain trusted X11 forwarding privileges by leveraging configuration issues on this X11 server, as demonstrated by lack of the SECURITY extension on this X11 server.





## [CVE-2015-8325](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-8325)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The do_setup_env function in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH through 7.2p2, when the UseLogin feature is enabled and PAM is configured to read .pam_environment files in user home directories, allows local users to gain privileges by triggering a crafted environment for the /bin/login program, as demonstrated by an LD_PRELOAD environment variable.





## [CVE-2016-10012](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10012)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The shared memory manager (associated with pre-authentication compression) in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not ensure that a bounds check is enforced by all compilers, which might allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a sandboxed privilege-separation process, related to the m_zback and m_zlib data structures.





## [CVE-2015-6564](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-6564)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Use-after-free vulnerability in the mm_answer_pam_free_ctx function in monitor.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging control of the sshd uid to send an unexpectedly early MONITOR_REQ_PAM_FREE_CTX request.





## [CVE-2016-10010](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10010)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4, when privilege separation is not used, creates forwarded Unix-domain sockets as root, which might allow local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors, related to serverloop.c.





## [CVE-2020-15778](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-15778)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: scp in OpenSSH through 8.3p1 allows command injection in the scp.c toremote function, as demonstrated by backtick characters in the destination argument. NOTE: the vendor reportedly has stated that they intentionally omit validation of "anomalous argument transfers" because that could "stand a great chance of breaking existing workflows."





## [CVE-2019-6111](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-6111)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys file).





## [CVE-2016-3115](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-3115)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in session.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.2p2 allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended shell-command restrictions via crafted X11 forwarding data, related to the (1) do_authenticated1 and (2) session_x11_req functions.





## [CVE-2017-15906](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-15906)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The process_open function in sftp-server.c in OpenSSH before 7.6 does not properly prevent write operations in readonly mode, which allows attackers to create zero-length files.





## [CVE-2016-10708](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10708)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via an out-of-sequence NEWKEYS message, as demonstrated by Honggfuzz, related to kex.c and packet.c.





## [CVE-2018-15473](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-15473)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: OpenSSH through 7.7 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability due to not delaying bailout for an invalid authenticating user until after the packet containing the request has been fully parsed, related to auth2-gss.c, auth2-hostbased.c, and auth2-pubkey.c.





## [CVE-2018-15919](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-15919)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Remotely observable behaviour in auth-gss2.c in OpenSSH through 7.8 could be used by remote attackers to detect existence of users on a target system when GSS2 is in use. NOTE: the discoverer states 'We understand that the OpenSSH developers do not want to treat such a username enumeration (or "oracle") as a vulnerability.'





## [CVE-2016-0778](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-0778)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The (1) roaming_read and (2) roaming_write functions in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2, when certain proxy and forward options are enabled, do not properly maintain connection file descriptors, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by requesting many forwardings.





## [CVE-2021-41617](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-41617)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.x before 8.8, when certain non-default configurations are used, allows privilege escalation because supplemental groups are not initialized as expected. Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with privileges associated with group memberships of the sshd process, if the configuration specifies running the command as a different user.





## [CVE-2015-5352](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-5352)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The x11_open_helper function in channels.c in ssh in OpenSSH before 6.9, when ForwardX11Trusted mode is not used, lacks a check of the refusal deadline for X connections, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a connection outside of the permitted time window.





## [CVE-2016-6210](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-6210)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate users by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a large password is provided.





## [CVE-2020-14145](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-14145)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The client side in OpenSSH 5.7 through 8.4 has an Observable Discrepancy leading to an information leak in the algorithm negotiation. This allows man-in-the-middle attackers to target initial connection attempts (where no host key for the server has been cached by the client). NOTE: some reports state that 8.5 and 8.6 are also affected.





## [CVE-2016-20012](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-20012)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: OpenSSH through 8.7 allows remote attackers, who have a suspicion that a certain combination of username and public key is known to an SSH server, to test whether this suspicion is correct. This occurs because a challenge is sent only when that combination could be valid for a login session. NOTE: the vendor does not recognize user enumeration as a vulnerability for this product





## [CVE-2016-0777](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-0777)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The resend_bytes function in roaming_common.c in the client in OpenSSH 5.x, 6.x, and 7.x before 7.1p2 allows remote servers to obtain sensitive information from process memory by requesting transmission of an entire buffer, as demonstrated by reading a private key.





## [CVE-2019-6109](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-6109)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.





## [CVE-2019-6110](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-6110)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In OpenSSH 7.9, due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the server, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can manipulate the client output, for example to use ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred.





## [CVE-2018-20685](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-20685)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In OpenSSH 7.9, scp.c in the scp client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.





## [CVE-2021-36368](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-36368)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed.





## [CVE-2016-10011](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-10011)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: authfile.c in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.4 does not properly consider the effects of realloc on buffer contents, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive private-key information by leveraging access to a privilege-separated child process.





## [CVE-2015-6563](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-6563)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The monitor component in sshd in OpenSSH before 7.0 on non-OpenBSD platforms accepts extraneous username data in MONITOR_REQ_PAM_INIT_CTX requests, which allows local users to conduct impersonation attacks by leveraging any SSH login access in conjunction with control of the sshd uid to send a crafted MONITOR_REQ_PWNAM request, related to monitor.c and monitor_wrap.c.





## [CVE-2023-38408](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-38408)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system. (Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.) NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-10009.





## [CVE-2023-48795](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-48795)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:openbsd:openssh:6.6:p1:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may consequently end up with a connection for which some security features have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack.

## [CVE-2015-3183](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-3183)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The chunked transfer coding implementation in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.14 does not properly parse chunk headers, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a crafted request, related to mishandling of large chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension characters in modules/http/http_filters.c.





## [CVE-2015-3184](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-3184)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: mod_authz_svn in Apache Subversion 1.7.x before 1.7.21 and 1.8.x before 1.8.14, when using Apache httpd 2.4.x, does not properly restrict anonymous access, which allows remote anonymous users to read hidden files via the path name.





## [CVE-2016-0736](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-0736)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.





## [CVE-2016-2161](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-2161)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## [CVE-2016-8743](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-8743)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.





## [CVE-2017-9798](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-9798)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Apache httpd allows remote attackers to read secret data from process memory if the Limit directive can be set in a user's .htaccess file, or if httpd.conf has certain misconfigurations, aka Optionsbleed. This affects the Apache HTTP Server through 2.2.34 and 2.4.x through 2.4.27. The attacker sends an unauthenticated OPTIONS HTTP request when attempting to read secret data. This is a use-after-free issue and thus secret data is not always sent, and the specific data depends on many factors including configuration. Exploitation with .htaccess can be blocked with a patch to the ap_limit_section function in server/core.c.





## [CVE-2017-15710](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-15710)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.





## [CVE-2018-1303](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-1303)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A specially crafted HTTP request header could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 due to an out of bound read while preparing data to be cached in shared memory. It could be used as a Denial of Service attack against users of mod_cache_socache. The vulnerability is considered as low risk since mod_cache_socache is not widely used, mod_cache_disk is not concerned by this vulnerability.





## [CVE-2018-17199](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-17199)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Apache HTTP Server 2.4 release 2.4.37 and prior, mod_session checks the session expiry time before decoding the session. This causes session expiry time to be ignored for mod_session_cookie sessions since the expiry time is loaded when the session is decoded.





## [CVE-2019-0220](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-0220)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A vulnerability was found in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.0 to 2.4.38. When the path component of a request URL contains multiple consecutive slashes ('/'), directives such as LocationMatch and RewriteRule must account for duplicates in regular expressions while other aspects of the servers processing will implicitly collapse them.

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: mod_lua.c in the mod_lua module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.3.x and 2.4.x through 2.4.10 does not support an httpd configuration in which the same Lua authorization provider is used with different arguments within different contexts, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging multiple Require directives, as demonstrated by a configuration that specifies authorization for one group to access a certain directory, and authorization for a second group to access a second directory.





## [CVE-2015-3185](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-3185)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The ap_some_auth_required function in server/request.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.4.x before 2.4.14 does not consider that a Require directive may be associated with an authorization setting rather than an authentication setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging the presence of a module that relies on the 2.2 API behavior.





## [CVE-2018-1301](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-1301)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A specially crafted request could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30, due to an out of bound access after a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header. This vulnerability is considered very hard if not impossible to trigger in non-debug mode (both log and build level), so it is classified as low risk for common server usage.





## [CVE-2018-1302](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-1302)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: When an HTTP/2 stream was destroyed after being handled, the Apache HTTP Server prior to version 2.4.30 could have written a NULL pointer potentially to an already freed memory. The memory pools maintained by the server make this vulnerability hard to trigger in usual configurations, the reporter and the team could not reproduce it outside debug builds, so it is classified as low risk.





## [CVE-2016-4975](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2016-4975)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Possible CRLF injection allowing HTTP response splitting attacks for sites which use mod_userdir. This issue was mitigated by changes made in 2.4.25 and 2.2.32 which prohibit CR or LF injection into the "Location" or other outbound header key or value. Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.25 (Affected 2.4.1-2.4.23). Fixed in Apache HTTP Server 2.2.32 (Affected 2.2.0-2.2.31).

## [CVE-2022-37436](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-37436)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Prior to Apache HTTP Server 2.4.55, a malicious backend can cause the response headers to be truncated early, resulting in some headers being incorporated into the response body. If the later headers have any security purpose, they will not be interpreted by the client.





## [CVE-2023-25690](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-25690)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack.




Configurations are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of RewriteRule
 or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches
 some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is then
 re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable 
substitution. For example, something like:




RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]
ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/


Request splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and cache poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version 2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.








## [CVE-2023-31122](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-31122)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

## [CVE-2023-45802](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-45802)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:apache:http_server:2.4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.

This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.

Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Heimdal before 7.4 allows remote attackers to impersonate services with Orpheus' Lyre attacks because it obtains service-principal names in a way that violates the Kerberos 5 protocol specification. In _krb5_extract_ticket() the KDC-REP service name must be obtained from the encrypted version stored in 'enc_part' instead of the unencrypted version stored in 'ticket'. Use of the unencrypted version provides an opportunity for successful server impersonation and other attacks. NOTE: this CVE is only for Heimdal and other products that embed Heimdal code; it does not apply to other instances in which this part of the Kerberos 5 protocol specification is violated.

Summary: A flaw was found in samba versions 4.0.0 to 4.5.2. The Samba routine ndr_pull_dnsp_name contains an integer wrap problem, leading to an attacker-controlled memory overwrite. ndr_pull_dnsp_name parses data from the Samba Active Directory ldb database. Any user who can write to the dnsRecord attribute over LDAP can trigger this memory corruption. By default, all authenticated LDAP users can write to the dnsRecord attribute on new DNS objects. This makes the defect a remote privilege escalation.





## [CVE-2020-25718](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-25718)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In DCE/RPC it is possible to share the handles (cookies for resource state) between multiple connections via a mechanism called 'association groups'. These handles can reference connections to our sam.ldb database. However while the database was correctly shared, the user credentials state was only pointed at, and when one connection within that association group ended, the database would be left pointing at an invalid 'struct session_info'. The most likely outcome here is a crash, but it is possible that the use-after-free could instead allow different user state to be pointed at and this might allow more privileged access.





## [CVE-2019-14870](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-14870)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation model includes a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be opted out of constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self or regular Kerberos authentication, by forcing all tickets for these clients to be non-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user attribute delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which translates to disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does not do that for S4U2Self and does set the forwardable flag even if the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.

Summary: A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in Samba's LDAP server before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, and 4.9.3. A CNAME loop could lead to infinite recursion in the server. An unprivileged local attacker could create such an entry, leading to denial of service.





## [CVE-2018-16841](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-16841)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Samba from version 4.3.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7 and 4.9.3 are vulnerable to a denial of service. When configured to accept smart-card authentication, Samba's KDC will call talloc_free() twice on the same memory if the principal in a validly signed certificate does not match the principal in the AS-REQ. This is only possible after authentication with a trusted certificate. talloc is robust against further corruption from a double-free with talloc_free() and directly calls abort(), terminating the KDC process.





## [CVE-2018-16851](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2018-16851)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Samba from version 4.0.0 and before versions 4.7.12, 4.8.7, 4.9.3 is vulnerable to a denial of service. During the processing of an LDAP search before Samba's AD DC returns the LDAP entries to the client, the entries are cached in a single memory object with a maximum size of 256MB. When this size is reached, the Samba process providing the LDAP service will follow the NULL pointer, terminating the process. There is no further vulnerability associated with this issue, merely a denial of service.

## [CVE-2019-14861](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-14861)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: All Samba versions 4.x.x before 4.9.17, 4.10.x before 4.10.11 and 4.11.x before 4.11.3 have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe provides administrative facilities to modify DNS records and zones. Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP. In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation of new records by authenticated users. This is used for example to allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record was created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare() routines could be confused into reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding to DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following invalid memory as a pointer.





## [CVE-2021-44141](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-44141)

## [CVE-2022-32742](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-32742)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A flaw was found in Samba. Some SMB1 write requests were not correctly range-checked to ensure the client had sent enough data to fulfill the write, allowing server memory contents to be written into the file (or printer) instead of client-supplied data. The client cannot control the area of the server memory written to the file (or printer).





## [CVE-2022-32744](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-32744)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A flaw was found in Samba. The KDC accepts kpasswd requests encrypted with any key known to it. By encrypting forged kpasswd requests with its own key, a user can change other users' passwords, enabling full domain takeover.





## [CVE-2022-32746](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-32746)

This issue is only possible when modifying certain privileged attributes, such as userAccountControl.





## [CVE-2022-0336](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-0336)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The Samba AD DC includes checks when adding service principals names (SPNs) to an account to ensure that SPNs do not alias with those already in the database. Some of these checks are able to be bypassed if an account modification re-adds an SPN that was previously present on that account, such as one added when a computer is joined to a domain. An attacker who has the ability to write to an account can exploit this to perform a denial-of-service attack by adding an SPN that matches an existing service. Additionally, an attacker who can intercept traffic can impersonate existing services, resulting in a loss of confidentiality and integrity.





## [CVE-2022-1615](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-1615)

## [CVE-2023-34966](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-34966)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: An infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the client, the core unmarshalling function sl_unpack_loop() did not validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value, the attacked function will run in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU. This flaw allows an attacker to issue a malformed RPC request, triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service condition.





## [CVE-2023-34967](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-34967)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in the mdssvc protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated with a key, a caller may trigger a crash in talloc_get_size() when talloc detects that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc pointer. With an RPC worker process shared among multiple client connections, a malicious client or attacker can trigger a process crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process, affecting all other clients this worker serves.





## [CVE-2023-34968](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-34968)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A path disclosure vulnerability was found in Samba. As part of the Spotlight protocol, Samba discloses the server-side absolute path of shares, files, and directories in the results for search queries. This flaw allows a malicious client or an attacker with a targeted RPC request to view the information that is part of the disclosed path.





## [CVE-2023-5568](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-5568)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A heap-based Buffer Overflow flaw was discovered in Samba. It could allow a remote, authenticated attacker to exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service.





## [CVE-2023-42670](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-42670)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A flaw was found in Samba. It is susceptible to a vulnerability where multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing disruptions in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences a high load or unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC purposes (for example, NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously start and compete for the same unix domain sockets. This issue leads to partial query responses from the AD DC, causing issues such as "The procedure number is out of range" when using tools like Active Directory Users. This flaw allows an attacker to disrupt AD DC services.





## [CVE-2023-4091](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-4091)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB clients to truncate files, even with read-only permissions when the Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" is configured with "acl_xattr:ignore system acls = yes". The SMB protocol allows opening files when the client requests read-only access but then implicitly truncates the opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE create disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on Samba's permissions.





## [CVE-2023-3961](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-3961)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing client pipe names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a private directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS, which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise or service crashes.





## [CVE-2023-42669](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-42669)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A vulnerability was found in Samba's "rpcecho" development server, a non-Windows RPC server used to test Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements. This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked indefinitely. The issue arises because the "rpcecho" service operates with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the "rpcecho" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the "dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()" function under specific conditions. Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to block for a specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all other services as "rpcecho" runs in the main RPC task.





## [CVE-2023-4154](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-4154)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:samba:samba:4.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: A design flaw was found in Samba's DirSync control implementation, which exposes passwords and secrets in Active Directory to privileged users and Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs). This flaw allows RODCs and users possessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes, including sensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup, RODC DC accounts, which should only replicate some passwords, can gain access to all domain secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively eliminating the RODC / DC distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability fails to account for error conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory situations, potentially granting access to secret attributes, even under low-privileged attacker influence.





## [CVE-2015-1158](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2015-1158)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:cups:cups:1.7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The add_job function in scheduler/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 2.0.3 performs incorrect free operations for multiple-value job-originating-host-name attributes, which allows remote attackers to trigger data corruption for reference-counted strings via a crafted (1) IPP_CREATE_JOB or (2) IPP_PRINT_JOB request, as demonstrated by replacing the configuration file and consequently executing arbitrary code.

Summary: The OpenSSL ECDSA signature algorithm has been shown to be vulnerable to a timing side channel attack. An attacker could use variations in the signing algorithm to recover the private key. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0j (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0i). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1a (Affected 1.1.1).





## [CVE-2020-1971](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-1971)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:oracle:mysql:5.5.62:*:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty 7.2.2 to 9.4.38, 10.0.0.alpha0 to 10.0.1, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.1, CPU usage can reach 100% upon receiving a large invalid TLS frame.





## [CVE-2017-7657](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-7657)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), transfer-encoding chunks are handled poorly. The chunk length parsing was vulnerable to an integer overflow. Thus a large chunk size could be interpreted as a smaller chunk size and content sent as chunk body could be interpreted as a pipelined request. If Jetty was deployed behind an intermediary that imposed some authorization and that intermediary allowed arbitrarily large chunks to be passed on unchanged, then this flaw could be used to bypass the authorization imposed by the intermediary as the fake pipelined request would not be interpreted by the intermediary as a request.





## [CVE-2017-7658](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-7658)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty Server, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all non HTTP/1.x configurations), and 9.4.x (all HTTP/1.x configurations), when presented with two content-lengths headers, Jetty ignored the second. When presented with a content-length and a chunked encoding header, the content-length was ignored (as per RFC 2616). If an intermediary decided on the shorter length, but still passed on the longer body, then body content could be interpreted by Jetty as a pipelined request. If the intermediary was imposing authorization, the fake pipelined request would bypass that authorization.





## [CVE-2017-9735](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-9735)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Jetty through 9.4.x is prone to a timing channel in util/security/Password.java, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by observing elapsed times before rejection of incorrect passwords.





## [CVE-2017-7656](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2017-7656)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty, versions 9.2.x and older, 9.3.x (all configurations), and 9.4.x (non-default configuration with RFC2616 compliance enabled), HTTP/0.9 is handled poorly. An HTTP/1 style request line (i.e. method space URI space version) that declares a version of HTTP/0.9 was accepted and treated as a 0.9 request. If deployed behind an intermediary that also accepted and passed through the 0.9 version (but did not act on it), then the response sent could be interpreted by the intermediary as HTTP/1 headers. This could be used to poison the cache if the server allowed the origin client to generate arbitrary content in the response.





## [CVE-2019-10247](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2019-10247)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty version 7.x, 8.x, 9.2.27 and older, 9.3.26 and older, and 9.4.16 and older, the server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will reveal the configured fully qualified directory base resource location on the output of the 404 error for not finding a Context that matches the requested path. The default server behavior on jetty-distribution and jetty-home will include at the end of the Handler tree a DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting this 404 error, it presents the various configured contexts as HTML for users to click through to. This produced HTML includes output that contains the configured fully qualified directory base resource location for each context.





## [CVE-2021-28169](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-28169)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, it is possible for requests to the ConcatServlet with a doubly encoded path to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory. For example a request to `/concat?/%2557EB-INF/web.xml` can retrieve the web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the implementation of a web application.





## [CVE-2022-2048](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-2048)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty HTTP/2 server implementation, when encountering an invalid HTTP/2 request, the error handling has a bug that can wind up not properly cleaning up the active connections and associated resources. This can lead to a Denial of Service scenario where there are no enough resources left to process good requests.





## [CVE-2020-27216](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2020-27216)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1 thru 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege escalation vulnerability.





## [CVE-2022-2047](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2022-2047)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: In Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.0 thru 9.4.46, and 10.0.0 thru 10.0.9, and 11.0.0 thru 11.0.9 versions, the parsing of the authority segment of an http scheme URI, the Jetty HttpURI class improperly detects an invalid input as a hostname. This can lead to failures in a Proxy scenario.





## [CVE-2021-34428](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2021-34428)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: For Eclipse Jetty versions <= 9.4.40, <= 10.0.2, <= 11.0.2, if an exception is thrown from the SessionListener#sessionDestroyed() method, then the session ID is not invalidated in the session ID manager. On deployments with clustered sessions and multiple contexts this can result in a session not being invalidated. This can result in an application used on a shared computer being left logged in.





## [CVE-2023-26048](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-26048)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with `@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or `HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no filename and very large content. This happens even with the default settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter `maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value, so the whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).





## [CVE-2023-26049](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-26049)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie VALUE that starts with `"` (double quote), it will continue to read the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE="b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3 separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say, JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it. This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.





## [CVE-2023-44487](https://www.opencve.io/cve/CVE-2023-44487)

 !--> CVE for cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:jetty:8.1.7:20120910:*:*:*:*:*:*

Summary: The HTTP/2 protocol allows a denial of service (server resource consumption) because request cancellation can reset many streams quickly, as exploited in the wild in August through October 2023.
